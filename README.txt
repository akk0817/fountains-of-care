# Fountains of Care — Landing Page (GitHub Pages)

This is a clean single-page landing site built from your flyer content.

## Files
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `assets/` (images)

## Publish on GitHub Pages (free)
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one).
2. Click **New repository**
   - Name: `fountains-of-care`
   - Set to **Public**
3. Upload ALL files/folders from this zip (keep the same structure).
4. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or `master`) and folder `/ (root)`
5. Save. Your link will appear in a minute, usually:
   `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/fountains-of-care/`

## Notes
- The enquiry form opens the visitor's email app and sends to `info@fountainsofcare.com.au`.
- If you want a real online form (submits without email app), tell me and I’ll switch it to a free Formspree/Netlify form.
